what_i_learned: |
   Today, I was able to speak with my faculty mentor personally and learn a lot more of the project and the things that we have in store! I had the chance to learn more about what the African Diapsora entails and learn about various defintitions that helped me understand on a deeper level. I was able to sit down and research some of the cultural traditions, foods and more of these countries! During this research, i learned about the different kinship traditions amongst different countries. Then, I was able to take the chance to learn more about the musical roots of jazz, pop and soul.

reflection: |
  During today's lab session, I was able to talk with one of my team members and faculty mentors about the project just to help myself gain a deeper knowledge of what we are actually doing. It was nice to be able to ask questions and gain more insight without being ridculed for not knowing anything since we are just starting out on the research. I was able to take a deep dive on more of the cultural aspects and learn more about the various cultures within the diaspora. This is where I was able to educate myself on the different roles that countries played in our culture.
