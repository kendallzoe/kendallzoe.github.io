what_i_learned: |
  As of today, we have learned more about our faculty and graduate assistants on our project! It was nice talking with them and learning more about their background and the project itself. I had learned more about Python and the functions, strings and etc that are necessary for beginners. 

blockers: |
  no blockers.

reflection: |
  For the first half of the day we have learned about faculty at Morgan and took the time to learn more about making blog posts on Github! Then for the next half of the day we got into groups based on our score of the placement test and learned more about python. At the end of the day we played Headbanz which was really fun!
