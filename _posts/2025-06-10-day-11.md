what_i_learned: |
   Today I had the privilege of learning how deeply dress and adornment are tied to history, identity, and survival! In doing research about the clothing and also the migration from/to these countries, I found that these communities expressed themselves through the cloth and also used beads to mark the rite of passage or even social status. I used to think of clothing mostly in terms of fashion or style, but now I see how it served a greater purpose for these communities.

  no blockers.

reflection: |
  While learning about the clothing and migration of certain countries, I also learned how to utilize AI properly. In previous coursework, I had just used AI for everything and wondered why I would sometimes get answers wrong. But, now I understand it is important to always fact check my work. Moving forward, I have realized that I must double check any answers I get from ChatGPT with reputable sources such as google scholar or britannica!
