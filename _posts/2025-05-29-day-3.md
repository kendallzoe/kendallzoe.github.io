what_i_learned: |
  I had learned a lot today! We had a workshop on Computer Vision and this is where I was able to take various images on Teachable Machine which I did not know was a website that Google had. In addition to this, we had also used Yolo v8 which I learned a lot about and its usage of Object Dectection. Then, I had my Python 101 class and this is where i learned about naming new variables and making things such as a wage calculator.

blockers: |
  no blockers.

reflection: |
  I had a lot of fun today learning about new things! The computer vision was more fun then I thought it was going to be! Then, I was able to communicate with my group members in a  very fun and unique way! Lastly, I was able to learn a ton of new Python skills as well!
