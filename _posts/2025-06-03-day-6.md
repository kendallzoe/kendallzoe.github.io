what_i_learned: |
   Today I was able to explore a little bit more of campus and figure out where the microwave was! But, during my labs I was able to watch a video on sentiment analysis, to be frank I did not retain much from the video since the terms were too advanced but I still followed it along. From what I gathered, sentiment analysis is a process used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine whether a piece of text like a product review or comment expresses a certain emotion. The video also introduced some concepts like machine learning models and labeled datasets, which I didn’t fully grasp yet, but I now have a general understanding that these tools help train computers to recognize and categorize emotions in language.

reflection: |
  Today I was able to explore a little bit more of campus and figure out where the microwave was! It felt good to get more familiar with my surroundings and take another step toward feeling at home. During my labs, I had the opportunity to watch a video on sentiment analysis. To be honest, I found the content a bit overwhelming because many of the concepts were unfamiliar. Although I didn’t retain as much as I hoped, I still tried my best to follow along and pick up what I could. I’m realizing that it might take a few more passes through the material to really understand it, but I’m not discouraged. It’s all part of the learning process, and I’m glad I was at least exposed to it today.
