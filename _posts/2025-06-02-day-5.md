what_i_learned: |
  I had learned a lot on the first in person day! I was able to meet the faculty and the directors of the program! I had learned about the dangers and things to be wary about regarding AI. I did not realize how much bias was actually within these models. From the healthcare, to the resumes and more, I am much more knowledgeable now regarding the problems. Then, I learned about Large Language Models which is a machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks. I had also learned about creating a hypothesis for a research project.

blockers: |
  I have no blockers today. 

reflection: |
  I enjoyed the first day in person a lot! I had enjoyed getting to know those in the cohort and getting to know my project members more. I was able to learn about the program itself and safe to say I am very glad that I am here! After doing an icebreaker I was able to spend time in my lab and learn a lot more about my project and get tikme with my faculty mentor and graduate mentor one on one. I am very excited to get into the actual research and coding of the project.
