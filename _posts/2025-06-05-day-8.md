what_i_learned: |
  I had fun today! I was able to learn a lot about the campus and some new spots I can visit. I had the chance to learn more about my peers in the program by being able to connect with them during the tour. Then, I was able to come back to my group and finish learning about creating a website! It took a while but I was able to complete it!

  no blockers.

reflection: |
  For today's tour, I was able to explore the campus and learn more about the place I will be attending for the next few months. While it was hot outside, it was nice being able to get some steps in, hydrate and look at everything the campus has to offer. In addition to this, I was able to talk with other students and hear more about how they felt about their own campus! Then, we had went with our graduate mentors and thats when I kept working on the project for today.
