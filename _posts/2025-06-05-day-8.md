what_i_learned: |
  I had fun today! I was able to learn a lot about the campus and some new spots I can visit. I had the chance to learn more about my peers in the program by being able to connect with them during the tour. After that, I came back to my group, and we jumped right back into learning how to create a website. It was a bit challenging at first, but also really exciting. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. This included things like how to structure content using tags and how to style it using things like color, font size, and margins. I also started to understand how different elements like headers, images, links, and lists are organized on a page.

reflection: |
  For today's tour, I was able to explore the campus and learn more about the place I will be attending for the next few months. While it was hot outside, it was nice being able to get some steps in, hydrate and look at everything the campus has to offer. In addition to this, I was able to talk with other students and hear more about how they felt about their own campus! Then, we had went with our graduate mentors and thats when I kept working on the project for today.
