what_i_learned: |
  Today I was able to learn more about the fellow students around me and even talk to some that I usually do not see on a regular basis. It was nice getting to know people since I will be with them all summer. Then, after lunch my team and I had jumped back into the research of our project. I had mainly continued my work of finding reputable sources for the information I found via AI on the various countries in the African Diaspora. Needless to say this might take a minute to do since I have to comb through different websites.

  For today's enrichment block, I had fun getting to know the other students in my cohort! At first, we were talking about potential field trip ideas such as an amusement park, NASA, a musuem and some other fun places! Then, we had started to show our competitive sides by playing various games such as Taboo or Jenga. I had personally never played Taboo so it was very nerve-wrecking when I went up for my turn. I had fun though and gotten my team like 4 points! Team 2 had also won the taboo, so now I can come a hour later on a day of my choice! While we had lost the jenga game, I still had fun today during the block.
