what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent time going through and verifying sources for my research, using tools like Google Scholar, Britannica, and other reputable databases. I found that Google Scholar was especially helpful for accessing peer-reviewed journal articles and scholarly papers, which provided strong academic credibility to my work. Britannica helped give me a clear and concise overview of certain topics, allowing me to build a foundational understanding before diving deeper. I also compared information across multiple sources to make sure facts were consistent and up to date. In addition to this, I watched some more beginnner videos on HTML and CSS, I was able to learn how to change the background and color of my text.

reflection: |
  While verifying sources for my research on the African diaspora, I learned how important it is to cross-check information to get a full, accurate picture of history. Using platforms like Google Scholar, Britannica, and academic databases, I was able to explore different perspectives on key events such as the transatlantic slave trade, post-emancipation migration patterns, and cultural retention across the diaspora. Needless to say it has been very fun learning more about my background as an African American woman whilst learning how to build a website! It feels like I am becoming more and more educated each day which is good because I am having fun while doing it.
