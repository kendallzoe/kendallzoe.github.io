what_i_learned: |
  Today was my first day at the CEAMLS SAIRI program and needless to say it was fun! I had learned more about my fellow team members which was nice. One of my project members is from Alabama and two others are very knowledgable on computer science.

  I also started exploring GIT and learned more about various commands such as Git pull and Git push

blockers: |
  no blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice learning more about GIT and starting to create this repository on Github, I am content with what I have been doing and can not wait to see what the future has in store.
