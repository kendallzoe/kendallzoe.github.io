what_i_learned: |
  For today's session, we were able to dive into the workings of building a website. Our graduate mentor had set us up with a yotube video that helped us create a website using html and CSS! I had learned a lot regarding the starting of making a website. In addition to that, we were able to talk with our faculty mentor more about the expectations about the project.
blockers: |
  I have no blockers today. 

reflection: |
  Today was informative as we were able to learn more about using html and css! I was introduced to VScode on the zoom meetings but actually had downloaded it and used it today! it took me a minute to get set up with everything and really understand how to use VScode, but once I did I was able to successfully build a website. The next steps after building this website is now to add on information regarding our project.
