what_i_learned: |
   I was able to learn a little bit more on finding good resources to use for the dataset. This really looked like me combing through articles and deciding which was the best for the project. Then, I was able to learn a little bit more on the front-end development of the actual project. I had the assistance from AI which was helpful in creating the website and giving me a preview of my code. During this process I had also watched various youtube videos on creating this in VS code.
blockers: |
  no blockers.

reflection: |
  For today's lab session, I was able to familiarize myself more with VScode! We were given the task next week to create the front-end design of the actual project but I decided to jump the gun so that we are mainly focused on fixing the dataset for next week so that we have a started website to present for the symposium. Then, I was able to watch videos on VS code to teach myself how to start the front-end development of the website.
