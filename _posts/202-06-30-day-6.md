what_i_learned: |
   Today I was able to explore a little bit more of campus and figure out where the microwave was! But, during my labs I was able to watch a video on sentiment analysis, to be frank I did not retain much from the video since the terms were too advanced but I still followed it along.

blockers: |
  I have no blockers.

reflection: |
  For today's time in the lab, our graduate instructor had us watch a video on a sentiment analysis project. I am still confused on how to actually execute it on my own but I was able to create a code from following the video! Then, after lunch we had came back into our labs and was able to start a little research on our projects and start creating tables of data and inputting them into google colab
