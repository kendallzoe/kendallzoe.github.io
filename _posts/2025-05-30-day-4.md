what_i_learned: |
  I had enjoyed learning more Python 101 today! It was the last class I had with Clyde and today we had made a student grade calculator as a project! I had also learned about using Python tutor for code and got better with utilizing conditionals and naming different variables. There was also a workshop based on Generative AI which taught me about the history of computers and more.

reflection: |
  For the last day online, I had more fun then I anticipated. I was bummed to be in class with Clyde for the last time since he is a good teacher but I am thankful that I learned a lot. I was also able to see what funny AI generated videos that my fellow peers see which was funny to look up during my break. Then, we learned more about Gen AI which is useful as most of us will be ultizing AI for our projects. Lastly, we had worked on AI detection in photos which was really fun! I had enjoyed trying to figure out which photo was AI with my classmates!
