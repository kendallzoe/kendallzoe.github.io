what_i_learned: |
   While last week I started doing some research, today we went more in depth by country. I was researching countries like Ghana, Liberia, and the Republic of the Congo. It was fascinating to dive into their histories, cultures, and social structures. I learned that Ghana has a strong tradition of community and kinship, especially among the Akan people who follow a matrilineal system. Liberia’s history stood out to me because of its unique founding by formerly enslaved African Americans and how that has shaped its political and cultural identity.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a good day! I am getting closer with my team members and my mentors everyday! I am learning more about them as group members and how i function as a group member as well. I am also getting better at retaining information pertaining to the diaspora as well as the actual coding itself. I am starting to remember things such as opening and closing the tags, the different types of tags and more. I hope to start learning more about CSS soon.
