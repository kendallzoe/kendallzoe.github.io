  bio: |
    Iâ€™m currently a Senior studying Advertising at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 
    I expect to graduate in 2026!

    My work informs many of the different cultures, ethnicities, religions and more in the African Diaspora through a website with vetted resources!

    When Iâ€™m not working on research, I enjoy reading, hanging with my friends and watching youtube videos.
