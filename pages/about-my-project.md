subtitle: "A Central Platform for News, Culture, and Voices Across the African Diaspora"
project_title: "The African Diaspora Media Hub"

problem: |
  Many individuals around the world are ill-informed about African culture. There are significant informational gaps and underrepresented narratives that remain unheard, with limited cross-cultural connections among people of African descent globally.

  This project seeks to develop the African Diaspora Media Hub â€” a curated digital platform designed to aggregate, centralize, and share news, cultural insights, and historical context related to the global African diaspora.

approach: |
  The project follows a multi-stage development pipeline:

  - Front-end development, back-end support, and web scraping
  - Training natural language processing (NLP) models, testing recommendation systems, and analyzing user data
  - Conducting media analysis, curating historical and cultural documentation, and implementing fact-checking workflows
  - Video editing and content creation for social media engagement

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will produce a functional website with integrated APIs and interactive features. Visitors will be able to explore news, stories, and cultural content relevant to the African diaspora, fostering greater global understanding and connection.
