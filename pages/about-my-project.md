project_title: "The Afircan Disapora Media Hub"

problem: |
   Many Individuals around the world are ill informed of many things pertaining to Afircan Culture. There are many informational gaps, underrepresented narratives that have not been heard and not many cross-cultural connections among people of African Descent worldwide.

  This project seeks to develop an African Disapora Media hub which is a curated digital platform designed to aggregate and centralize news and more.

approach: |
  The project follows a multi-point pipeline:

  - Front-end devlopment, back-end support and web scraping 
  - Training NLP models, reccomendation system testing, and user data analysis
  - News/Media analysis, historical/cultural documentation and fact-checking
  - video editing and social media content creation.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a working website with function codes and working API intergrations. People will be able to browse the website and be informed of the news and many other things taking place within the African disapora.
